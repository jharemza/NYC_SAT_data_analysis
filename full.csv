Our goal is to teach social, technological and analytic skills in order to facilitate the development of the next generation of leaders. Our collaborative approach to education fosters a supportive community which raises the performance level of each individual. In our labs and classrooms, students learn by doing. Skilled and committed faculty teach with rigor and passion for their subjects. Housed in a dedicated building on The City College of New York campus, HSMSE gives students an early taste of college life as they eat in the college cafeteria and study in the college library. Newly-built science and engineering labs offer up-to-date equipment, and all classrooms have internet access and computers or laptop carts. Students are drawn from all five boroughs of NYC and hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds. When students graduate, they are prepared for college and for life beyond by HSMSE’s in-depth approach to learning. New York State Regents exams, while required, are viewed as minimal competencies which our students are expected to master.

Our ninth and tenth grade Academies feature a block schedule in which teams of teachers meet with guidance counselors to discuss and support each student's academic performance and socio-emotional development. The first two years at Lincoln are dedicated to meeting high school graduation requirements, while the junior and senior years in the upper academies are devoted to college and career readiness in the sciences or humanities. Lincoln provides students with the individualized attention of SLC, as well as the assets, resources, and facilities of a large comprehensive high school. We offer a state-of-the-art photography studio, two animal science labs, a vast library, multiple computer labs, spacious grounds, three gymnasiums and a swimming pool.
